Repo for LLM generated tools 


Experimenting with LLM generated mini applications based on NLP. Most of the code in this repo is 100% written by an LLM with no direct human manipulation to the codebase. 

So far this has worked as an excellent "staging ground" for project planning. The LLM built a low overhead application that can be rendered in browser. I am using that script as a basis of design for my Proportia tool in the StudioMuse repo.
